# GZDoom Curios

## About

Any GZDoom mod I've developed that's too small to merit its own repository goes into here.

- `drla-thrifty` is a mod that provides compatibility between the [Thrifty Health/Ammo mods](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=71406) by zrrion the insect and [DoomRL Arsenal](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=37044) by Yholl.
- `rat-crosshair` is a single, minimalist custom crosshair which meets my specific preferences: a hollow T-shape with fading ends.
- `chprog` contains an addon for [Colourful Hell](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=47980) by Hege Cactus, which introduces tiered progression over maps to reduce the chance of getting attacked by overly-powerful monsters too early in a playthrough.
