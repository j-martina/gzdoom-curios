# GZDoom Curios

## About

Any GZDoom mod I've developed that's too small to merit its own repository goes into here.

- `cartographer` is a mod which places map markers on any inventory item that's been seen by a player. Inspired directly by Sir Robin's [Loot Markers](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=75889) mod, but with the intent of delivering on a slimmer feature-set and higher performance.
- `disk-jockey` is a personal take on a music player mod, inspired by [Jimmy's Jukebox](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=29117) and Kinsie's [Floppy Disk Full of MIDIs](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=47189).
- `drla-bonsai` is a collection of new upgrades for ToxicFrog's [Gun Bonsai](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=76080) and Yholl's [DoomRL Arsenal](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=37044).
- `drla-thrifty` is a mod that provides compatibility between the [Thrifty Health/Ammo mods](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=71406) by zrrion the insect and DoomRL Arsenal.
- `drla-nomadic` (Nomadic Lifestyle) is a mod that generalises the behaviour of the Nomad class from Cutmanmike's [DoomRLA Extended](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=70549&sid=614591c4f860505a63dc3a55a263ad84) over all of DoomRL Arsenal, with some improvements.
- `final-doomer-x` is an extension for [Final Doomer](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55061) by Sgt. Shivers and Yholl which adds minor fixes, improvements, and quality-of-life changes. This includes alterations to the [Customizer add-on](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=65622) by cyber_cool.
- `rat-crosshair` is a single, minimalist custom crosshair which meets my specific preferences: a hollow T-shape with fading ends.
- `rat-tools` is where I put any development/debugging utilities that don't belong anywhere else.
- `chprog` contains an addon for [Colourful Hell](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=47980) by Hege Cactus, which introduces tiered progression over maps to reduce the chance of getting attacked by overly-powerful monsters too early in a playthrough.
