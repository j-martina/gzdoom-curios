# GZDoom Curios

## About

Any GZDoom mod I've developed that's too small to merit its own repository goes into here.

- `cartographer` is a mod which places map markers on any inventory item that's been seen by a player. Inspired directly by Sir Robin's [Loot Markers](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=75889) mod, but with the intent of delivering on a slimmer feature-set and higher performance.
- `disk-jockey` is a maximally-simple bring-your-own-music player.
- `drla-bonsai` is a collection of new upgrades for ToxicFrog's [Gun Bonsai](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=76080) and Yholl's [DoomRL Arsenal](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=37044).
- `drla-thrifty` is a mod that provides compatibility between the [Thrifty Health/Ammo mods](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=71406) by zrrion the insect and DoomRL Arsenal.
- `drlm-maladaptive` is a mod that changes the DoomRL Monster Pack's "Adaptive" difficulty to assign one constant weight to each monster grade, rather than adjusting the weighting with levels completed.
- `rat-fd` is an extension for [Final Doomer](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55061) by Sgt. Shivers and Yholl which personalizes it to fit my specific needs.
- `rat-crosshair` is a pair of minimalist custom crosshairs which meet my specific preferences: a hollow T-shape with fading ends, and a single-pixel-thickness upwards chevron.
- `rat-tools` is where I put any development/debugging utilities that don't belong anywhere else.
- `zsbench` is a set of naive ZScript microbenchmarks.
